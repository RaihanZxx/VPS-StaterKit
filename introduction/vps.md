# What is a Virtual Private Server (VPS)?

A Virtual Private Server (VPS) is a virtualized computing environment created by partitioning a physical server into multiple isolated virtual machines. Each VPS receives dedicated portions of CPU, RAM, storage, and network resources, providing the control and flexibility of a dedicated server at a lower cost.

## How it works
- A hypervisor (e.g., KVM, Xen, VMware) runs on the host and isolates multiple VPS instances.
- Each VPS runs its own operating system and typically offers root/administrator access (commonly via SSH).
- Resource quotas and isolation reduce noisy-neighbor effects and improve predictability.

## Common use cases
- Hosting websites and APIs
- Running application backends, databases, or message queues
- Game servers and real-time services
- Development/staging environments and CI runners
- Self-hosted services (VPN, monitoring, backups, etc.)

## Benefits
- Performance isolation and predictable resources
- Full control over OS, packages, and networking
- Scalable (resize plan or upgrade resources)
- Cost-effective compared to dedicated servers

## VPS vs. shared hosting vs. dedicated
- Shared hosting: cheapest, minimal control; resources broadly shared with limited isolation.
- VPS: more control and isolation, dedicated resource slices, root access.
- Dedicated server: full physical machine, highest performance/isolation, highest cost.

## Key considerations when choosing a VPS
- CPU/RAM, storage type (SSD/NVMe) and size, bandwidth quotas
- Data center location and network quality (latency, throughput)
- OS images, snapshots, and automated backups
- Security features, DDoS protection, SLA and support
- Managed vs. unmanaged service level

## Basic security best practices
- Prefer SSH keys over passwords; consider changing the default SSH port
- Keep OS and packages updated; enable automatic security updates if possible
- Configure a firewall (e.g., ufw, nftables) and intrusion mitigation (e.g., fail2ban)
- Use least-privilege accounts, monitor logs/metrics, and back up regularly
