# VPS Starter Kit

Minimal, script-driven toolkit to bootstrap and harden a fresh VPS quickly. Includes a colored dashboard with menu runner, Docker/Nginx installers, SSH hardening helpers, swap setup assistant, and basic firewall configuration.

## Features
- start.sh: dashboard (user, OS, IPs, SSH port, CPU, RAM, disk) + interactive menu for scripts in src/
- Root guard: if run as root, offers to create a non-root user, copies the app to that userâ€™s home, and re-runs
- Optional system update step before dashboard
- Installers: install-docker.sh, install-nginx.sh
- Setup: setup-basic.sh (enable SSH, UFW rules), setup-swap.sh (show specs, recommend swap, prompt size)
- Hardening: advanced-setup.sh (disable PermitRootLogin, change SSH port safely)

## Quick start
```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

## Requirements
- A modern Linux with systemd
- sudo access for privileged operations
- Optional: ufw, curl/wget, rsync
